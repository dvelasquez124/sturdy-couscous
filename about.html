                <p>I'm a full-time data professional by day, a part-time student by night, and a new-ish mom. Oh, and I

            <h2>Our First Trip</h2>
            <p>The first time I traveled with my daughter, I nearly turned around at the airport. Total sensory
                overload. So I closed my eyes... and imagined the beach.</p>

        <img src="./images/family.jpg" alt="a baby and two adults">
        <p>Hi there! My name is Diana. I'm a full-time paralegal by day, a part-time student by night, and a new
            mom. Oh, and I may or may not be addicted to traveling. Currently, I have two travel partners - my
            husband, Jenssy, and our 22-month-old daughter, Sophie.</p>
        <p>Fun fact: I didn't get on a plane until I was 15 years old. My daughter, on the other hand, has flown
            over 22 times!</p>
        <p>Traveling with a baby is not for the faint of heart, but you will have fun. The key is to plan ahead!
            Before you go any further, if you have a child that uses a stroller, do yourself a favor and buy <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Terrain-Lightweight-Stroller-Breathable-28x17-5x39-8/dp/B07S3XK19G">this</a>
            stroller.</p>
        <p>The first time that I went on vacation after giving birth to my daughter, I almost had a complete mental
            breakdown at the airport and turned around and went home. I sat down, handed my daughter to my husband,
            closed my eyes and went to my happy place - the beach.</p> 
            <p>Click below on the button below if you need some peace and relaxtion:</p>
            <button onclick="toggleMultimedia()" id="multimediaBtn">Show Multimedia</button>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="multimedia">
            <video width="200" src="./assets/video/beach.mp4" poster="./assets/video/beach.jpg" controls></video>
        <audio src="./assets/audio/beach.mp3" controls></audio>
        </div>
        
        <p>That first trip was rough, but it has since gotten so much easier. I'm so excited to share our adventures
            with you! Now, seriously, go buy that stroller. </p>
